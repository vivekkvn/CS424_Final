			<h2>Viz 4 : What is the relationship between Air bag deployed classification and Month of the Year, along with Gender?</h2>
			<p>Observation: We can see that all the different categories are consistent except in few cases. We also added interactivity by clicking on a section , which shows number of crashes related to a Gender which is consistent among all the sections. Therefore, we can conclude that Gender does not have any effect on air bag deployment and also month of year has minimal effect on air bag deployment</p>
			<p>interactivity: We can click on subsections of the stacked bar chart which will show number of male and female crashes along with the section you selected</p>
